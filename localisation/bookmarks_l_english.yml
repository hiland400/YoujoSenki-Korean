 BM_HISTORY_TITLE:0 "Brief History"
 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "War is Coming"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. The ever expansionist and power-hungry Empire searches for its next prey, as its final goal is total domination of mainland Europe and the elimination of its surrounding enemies. To the east, lies the red giant, which is always searching for a way to expand its eternal influence even more. What shall become of Europe as we know it? Who will bring total domination? Who will win?"
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "This country's history status is similar to the British Empire in World War I. In order to deny the birth of hegemonic nation in the continent, it formed the united front against the Empire with other great powers, encircling the Empire to achieve a balance in power. However, it seems that the nation, in the beginning of the conflict, has not yet a direct role(envoy of troops and such) in the continental conflict, thus it constantly give supplies to the Republic."
 REP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Francois Republic is one of the Empire's enemy nations and borders the Empire to the west. The Republic had launched a surprise attack while the Empire was focused on the war against the Legadonia Federation and had occupied part of the Empire's Rhine."
 EMP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Empire, or alternatively The Fatherland, is a powerful nation residing in the alternate Earth of which the main character, Tanya Degurechaff, was sent to following her first encounter with Being X. It is characterized by a strong military and rationalist attitude towards warfare. The Empire's capital and largest metropolis is Berlun."
 LEG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Legadonia Federation is one of the Empire's enemy nations, and is located over the northern border, with the area of Norden being contested between the Federation and the Empire.  A long time before the events of Youjo Senki occur, the Empire and the Federation had an unofficial dispute over the drawing of the national border, and nowadays after garrisons from both nations accidentally misfired, the firefights broke out because of some misunderstanding."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "This country's history status is similar to the Empire of Japan in 1900s. It had an official dispute with the Rus' Union over the drawing of the national border."
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "This country's history status is similar to the Soviet Union. Its former imperial government was the main allied of the Republic against the Empire, but the nation changed side after a revolution, which led to the birth of the new communist government and forced Republic to mainly rely on the Legedonia Alliance. The new government signed a nonaggression pact and other treaties with Empire, and kept its neutrality in the beginning of this war."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "This country's history status is similar to the United States in World War I. It is the creditor to most of the belligerents in this war. Its policy tended to keep its neutrality for the sake of commercial interests."
 DAC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Grand Duchy of Dacia is based on the Latin name that was given to ancient Romania/Bessarabia. According to Tanya's knowledge, Dacia is a minor state that had yet to achieve industrial revolution."
 ILD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ildoa's history status is similar to the Kingdom of Italy in World War I. Despite the Republic's exhortations for joining to the Allies, it formed an alliance with the Empire, maintaining its neutrality in the beginning of this war."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
 CAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a mere colony and left it as a nation. Born in the mud of Passchendaele, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled by the Great Depression and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"
 SAF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of the Great War chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendents of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the western front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the people of New Zealand look anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Blitzkrieg"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan. The new non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany may be bad news for the rest of Europe."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Munich agreement a year ago. However, German territorial expansion has made Italy see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germans could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
