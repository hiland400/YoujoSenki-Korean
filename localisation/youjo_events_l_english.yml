 empire.0.d:0 "For a long time, the Serbian nation, or as the Serbs call it, 'Hiltria', has distanced us from the Southern East nations of Europe, and from its creation, was ever hostile to us. The lands Hiltria possesses are very valuable because of their path to the Adriatic Sea. By annexing Hiltria, we would become even more threatening to our neighbours than before. What should we do with Hiltria, my emperor?"
 empire.0.a:0 "Annex everything!"

 dacia.20.d:0 "The Republican ambassador in Bucharest has begged us to help in the war efforts. Seeing as the Republic alone cannot stop the overwhelming Empire forces, he requested that we, the Dacian people join the war against the power-hungry Empire. What shall we do, president?"
 dacia.20.a:0 "Help our Republican Comrades!"
 dacia.20.b:0 "We cannot afford a war with the Empire."

 dacia.21.a:0 "God bless the Russy!"
 dacia.22.t:0 "Russy doesn't want to get involved..."
 dacia.22.d:0 "It seems that the communist regime to our east doesn't want to get invloved and help spread the revolution to our country. We are left to fight alone. Those traitors..."
 dacia.22.a:0 "We will remember this, Russy."
 news.500.t:0 "Dacia Joins the War"
 news.500.d:0 "After the Dacian government's ultimatum of repeling the Empire's unjust attack on the Francois Republic was rejected, the Dacian government cut all diplomatic ties with the Empire and declared an official war. The Empire ambassador to Bucharest was immediately arrested.

 news.501.t:0 "Civil war in Dacia!"
 news.501.d:0 "The communists in Dacia have just risen up and started a large-scale revolt against the Dacian former government! The country is currently in a state of civil war. It seems that the communist forces hold the majority of the country's land in the east, while the former Dacian government stil holds in the western side of the country. Recent reports suggest that the Empire, along with Hiltria, has entirely closed its Dacian border. The Russy Federation is yet to act."

 legadonia.500.t:0 "The Empire Refuses"
 legadonia.500.d:0 "After failed negotiations, Empire officials left the negotiating room with a clear answer of no. Should we call for mobalisation, or should we just give up trying to recover our precious and rightous territory?"

 legadonia.500.b:0 "We cannot aford a war with the Empire"
 legadonia.501.t:0 "A Chance to take the Scania Region!"
 legadonia.501.d:0 "The Empire is still recovering from the 1918 Industrial Disaster that hit it. Its people are very poor, and its military is greatly short-handed. This is probably our last chance to strike fast, overwhelm the Imperial garrison there and take back our lost region of Scania. We have received a secret message from the Francois Republic that they will aid us in case of war, too. This is the ideal scenario, let's strike!"

 empire.3.d:0 "The Legadonian government has just sent us a message claiming it will not give away any of the rightous Legadonian lands, and that Scania and Gotland should both be in the hands of the Legadonian Federation. Our government is still amused, as Scania is worth a lot more than the petty island of Gotland.  It seems we have been humiliated."
 empire.3.a:0 "Damn the Legadonians"
 empire.4.t:0 "Handing over Scania"
 empire.4.d:0 "We have decided to hand over scania to its rightful ruler, the Legadonian Federation. Now, the chances of a great war breaking in Europe are close to zero. We did the right thing, and now the world is going to start respect us."

 ildoa.20.t:0 "The Istria Crisis"
 ildoa.20.d:0 "The Empire has just sent us an ultimatum stating the 'rightful return' of the region of Istria. They state that Istria was always under their influence, and once was theirs, until it was 'stolen' by us. Of course, all of these are lies but we do not have the military capability to fight against the might of the Empire. What shall we do?"
 ildoa.20.a:0 "Accept"
 ildoa.20.b:0 "Decline"
 ildoa.21.t:0 "Istria Lost!"
 ildoa.21.d:0 "After ruthless fighting, Imperial troops have successfuly invaded Istria. Our troops, although inferior in both equipment and numbers have been fighting ever since, but it seems we cannot hold the enemies back anymore. The purpose of the war, defending the Istria region from the enemies, has been lost and the rest of our country will be the next target. Our cowardly generals suggest that we should surrender to 'avoid any more civilian casualties'. Should we surrender, or keep fighting until the last man dies?"

 ildoa.21.b:0 "Never surrender!"
 empire.6.t:0 "Ildoa Submits"
 empire.6.d:0 "The Ildoans are not fools, they know how to avoid a war they cannot win. The last of the Ildoan troops has just left the Istria region, and our forces are starting to move in. This is a great move my emperor, both strategicly and economicly. With Istria in our hands, we own an entrance to the Adriatic Sea, a sea we must control to support our militaristic ambitions."

 empire.7.t:0 "Ildoa Rejects"
 empire.7.d:0 "The Ildoans are fools to believe they are safe behind their petty little army. The Empire would never give up, even if it means war with the entire world! The time has come to achieve another of our great nation's militaristic ambitions!"

Although both nations are on good terms with each other, and sometimes even cooperate together in militaristic missions and trade agreements, the Empire's surprising demand was accepted by the Ildoan Kingdom.  At last, peace is restored to the region and the Istrian population was reported cheering at the entering Imperial troops. Europe has become a dangerous place, as nationalism is spreading throughout the world, and in any given moment, any country could start a great war for the sake of a little county."

Republican officials stated earlier that the conference is held to help European countries with the current economy crisis around the world, but it is obvious that it's about the Empire aggression lately. Out of the seven participating countries, only France, the Allied Kingdom and the Legadonian Federation signed a defensive alliance. However, all of the countries signed the economic pact the conference offered. Overall, the conference was considered a failure by the Republicans as only 3 countries signed a defensive treaty against the Empire. "

 news.916.d:0 "Earlier this morning, Republican troops have moved swiftly through the Republic-Empire border and occupied Alsace. Republican officials have claimed that Alsace was always a state of the Republic, and it should stay that way. It seems that by giving away Scania to the Legadonia Federation, a new weakness of the Empire was shown to the world, and new countries are beginning to claim imperial territories for themselves."
 news.916.a:0 "Eternal peace? Or more claims?"
 news.917.t:0 "Czechoslovakia is Free!"
 news.917.d:0 "Further military ultimatums have been placed on the Empire by its surronding neighbors, and thus it had to release the nation of the Czechs and Slovaks, because if not - many Czechs and Slovaks have threatened to gather a rebellion to overthrow the Empire.

 empire.11.t:0 "The Republic Rejects"
 empire.11.d:0 "It seems that the Republic rejected our offer to join their military alliance. After all we did, after we gave away imperial lands and released entire nations, they say no? We showed the entire world that we are not a threatening force, and yet the world does not accept it."

 news.918.d:0 "The Legadonian Federation has accepted to buy the Jutland region from the Empire in exchange for ending all hostilities between the two countries. The last Empire soldier left Jutland this morning and many imperial citizens have moved out to the new border to stay in their former country.

 empire.12.t:0 "The Allied Kingdom Accepts"
 empire.12.d:0 "Long ago, when we first set foot on the African continent, we thought we will become richer from its resources, amd a lot more powerful that we finaly have a foothold in Africa. It seems that nothing has changed since then, except that we now have to waste a lot of money to maintain our colony. It will be much better to obtain a foothold in Asia though. We will be able to trade more with the numerous Asian countries in the region, and it will also enable us to send troops far away from our home to aid our distant allies. "

 republic.501.d:0 "We've created this so-called military alliance for the sole purpose of defending against the might of the Empire. But now, as we saw it does no longer pose a threat to Europe, this military alliance has no goal whatsoever. The Empire has recently asked us to dismantle this military alliance, as it is now a threat to the Empire's safety. What should we do? Dismantling the alliance comes at a price. We will no longer recieve any aid from our strong allies."

 empire.14.t:0 "The Republic Refuses"
 empire.14.d:0 "The treacharous Republic refused our request to dismantle their coalition, even though we are not a threat to Europe anymore.

 empire.21.d:0 "The time has come to purge the unfaithful from our banners, and replace them with man who are loyal to our new proclaimed republic. This very important move might create a bit chaos and maybe even a small mutinity, but it will purify our armies and make them better in the end. What should we choose, dear president? "

 empire.23.t:0 "Berlun Promise"
 empire.23.d:0 "Our empire spreads across vast amounts of land from Belgium to Hungary, and we cannot turn a blind eye anymore, especially now when we're expected to bring peace and prosperity to Europe. Czech independence movements are now fairly popular in the Czech and Slovak regions, and the people have decided to start protesting. If we were to promise these people independence, our popularity in the continent will surely rise, and many nations will see us as less threatening. But if we were to do so, other minorities might rise up and also ask for independence. What should we decide?"

 empire.25.d:0 "The Empire has sent delegates to many neighboring countries proposing a defensive pact with each signing member if attacked by the Russy Federation. It might benefit us in the long run, as the Federation is indeed a threatening force at our doorsteps, but it might also damage us as we don't know much about the Empire's ambitions. Should we sign the pact?"

 empire.28.t:0 "A secret treaty with the Russy Federation?"
 empire.28.d:0 "It is well known that the Russy Federation is our enemy. The strongest one. But to achieve our goals, we must deal with the devil first. Our military advisors have come with an idea to form a non-agression pact with the Russy Federation. Of course, the pact wouldn't last for long, as its sole purpose is to buy time for us to acquire more territories and achieve our militaristic ambitions. Should we form the pact? Our neighbors won't like it, especially our enemies."

 empire.30.t:0 "The Russy Federation Accepts!"
 empire.30.d:0 "It seems the Russy Federation has accepted our proposal of a secret non-agression pact.

 empire.31.d:0 "Earlier today, the Emperor has given a very important speech to the public through the radio.

 empire.200.d:0 "It seems that The Republic has not fully surrendered. Moments after our forces entered Parisii, most of The Republican Free Army has already sailed to the colonies, mainly North Africa, to continue the fight. All our attempts to pursue peace with them have been met with failure. The Francois puppet we have set up has managed to occupy north Tunis and has asked us to support the effort with the African campaign. Should we send there troops and eventually manage to drive the Republican Free Army away? Or should we first center on Europe only?"

 republic.10.b:0 "Fight on! Free Francois!"
 republic.14.t:0 "The Republic Offers an Armistice"
 republic.14.d:0 "It seems that the Republic is finally aware of the fact that they have lost the battle. We are far superior in terms of military and combat ability than their pesky little army, and it wasn't a big problem crushing them. If we accept the armistice, we will have the chance to focus right away on our eastern enemies. Should we accept the armistice even though there's a large number of Republican troops that still oppose us, and the fight will go on? Or should we crush all of them even though it will take more time?"

 iwc_military_event.5.b:0 "Threatening? Us?!"
 iwc_military_event.6.t:0 "General Assembly is Outraged!"
 iwc_military_event.6.d:0 "After ignoring their demands for a couple of times, the council members of the General Assembly have given up any hope to negotiate a fair deal with the General Staff and are now taking revenge by making the lives of our people miserable! They have bribed some of our soldiers to join their cause and have closed several weapon factories across the country. This is a rebellion! What should we do?"

 #GER border war
 empire.500.t:0 "A Border War in Scania!"
 empire.500.d:0 "We have just recieved a high-classified important report from the northern HQ, sir! It seems that some Legadonian forces have started moving to our shared border in Scania! Legadonian artillery is mass shooting and soldiers are advancing rapidly. We have to prepare our forces and defend our lands as fast as possible!"
 empire.500.a:0 "Defend, Strike, Take!"
 empire.501.t:0 "Our soldiers are victorious"
 empire.501.d:0 "After a couple days of inconclusive skirmishes at the northern front in Norden, our soldiers there report that the Legadonian troops have fled the area, leaving their borders undefended. Our Chief of Staff Lieutenant General von Ludwig and the majority in the General Staff have elected to mobilize the reserves to start an invasion of the Entente Alliance. They state that with Legadonian troops on the retreat and unorganised, it is safe to say that they will surrender quickly. There is no sign that anyone else has mobilized, so it's unlikely that someone will attack us if we do invade. However, the Deputy Chief of Operations von Rudersdorf, along with Deputy Chief of the Service Corps, von Zettour, are against an all out attack, highlighting that such an invasion goes against Plan 315 and would leave us vulnerable, and the Entente Alliance is so weak to begin with that there's little to gain from invading them."
 empire.501.a:0 "The Legadonians have picked a fight and they shall get it."
 empire.501.b:0 "We are not ready, yet."
 empire.502.t:0 "We have lost."
 empire.502.d:0 "Legadonian forces have outnumbered us, and overpowered us with their mass artillery and mage shooting. It is not the fault of our military though, as we were caught offguard by the cowardly Legadonians. We must take Scania back someday."
 empire.502.a:0 "Damn the Legadonians."
